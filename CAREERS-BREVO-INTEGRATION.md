# Careers Page - Brevo Integration Setup

## Overview

All career application buttons on the Careers page are now connected to Brevo! When users click "Apply Now" or "Get In Touch", they see a professional application modal that:

âœ… Collects applicant information (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, portfolio, resume, cover letter)
âœ… Saves the application to Supabase `career_applications` table
âœ… Creates/updates the contact in Brevo with application details
âœ… Adds contact to your Brevo Careers list (if they opt in for updates)
âœ… Sends a notification email to hello@orjumedia.com with all application details

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create the Database Table

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gakgjtaykpflknfmezez/sql/new
   ```

2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/career-applications-schema.sql`

3. Paste and **Run** in the SQL editor

4. Verify: You should see the table created successfully

### Step 2: Create Brevo Careers List (If Not Already Created)

1. Go to **Brevo Dashboard** â†’ **Contacts** â†’ **Lists**
   ```
   https://app.brevo.com/contact/list
   ```

2. Click **Create a List**

3. Name it: `Careers - Job Applicants` or similar

4. Note the **List ID** (you'll need it in Step 3)

### Step 3: Set Brevo Careers List ID Secret

Choose **ONE** method:

#### Method A: Using Terminal (if you have Supabase CLI)
```bash
supabase secrets set BREVO_CAREERS_LIST_ID=YOUR_LIST_ID --project-ref gakgjtaykpflknfmezez
```
Replace `YOUR_LIST_ID` with the actual Brevo list ID from Step 2.

**Note:** The `BREVO_API_KEY` secret is already configured and will be reused.

### Step 4: Deploy the Edge Function

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd /workspaces/orju-media-collective
supabase functions deploy submit-career-application --project-ref gakgjtaykpflknfmezez
```

**Expected Output:**
```

2. **Check Supabase Database:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gakgjtaykpflknfmezez/editor
   - Select `career_applications` table
   - You should see your test application

3. **Check Brevo:**
   - Go to: https://app.brevo.com/contact
   - Search for the email you used in the test
   - Verify contact has all the custom attributes

4. Submit
5. **Expected Results:**

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Configuration error" in modal

**Cause:** Environment variables not set

**Fix:**
- Ensure `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are in `.env` (local) or Vercel env vars (production)

### Issue: Application saves to database but no email received

**Cause:** Edge Function failed

**Fix:**
1. Check Edge Function logs:
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs submit-career-application --project-ref gakgjtaykpflknfmezez
   ```
2. Verify `BREVO_API_KEY` secret is set correctly
3. Check Brevo API key permissions (needs contacts + email permissions)

### Issue: Contact not added to Brevo list

**Cause:** List ID not configured or incorrect

**Fix:**
1. Verify `BREVO_CAREERS_LIST_ID` secret is set
2. Verify the list ID is correct in Brevo dashboard
3. Check that user checked the "receive updates" checkbox

### Issue: Modal not opening when clicking buttons

**Cause:** JavaScript error or React state issue

**Fix:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure all imports are correct
3. Refresh the page and try again
