# ✅ Contact Form Integration - COMPLETE

## 🎉 What's Been Built

Your contact form is now fully integrated with Supabase and Brevo for automated email handling and contact management!

## 📋 Summary

### Frontend Changes (`src/pages/Contact.tsx`)
✅ Form captures all fields including "stay in touch" checkbox
✅ Validates required fields before submission
✅ Saves contact data to Supabase `contacts` table
✅ Invokes Edge Function to send to Brevo
✅ Shows success/error messages with toast notifications
✅ Resets form after successful submission

### Edge Function (`supabase/functions/send-contact-email`)
✅ Receives contact form data securely
✅ Creates/updates contact in Brevo with all attributes
✅ Automatically adds to marketing list if user opts in
✅ Sends notification email to `hello@orjumedia.com`
✅ Uses secure secrets for API keys (never exposed to frontend)
✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Documentation Created
✅ `DEPLOY-EDGE-FUNCTION.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
✅ `supabase/functions/send-contact-email/README.md` - Function documentation
✅ `deploy-function.sh` - Interactive deployment script
✅ Updated `DEPLOY.md` with Supabase function section

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Interactive Script)

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, make sure:

- [ ] Supabase project is created
- [ ] `contacts` table exists with correct columns
- [ ] Brevo account is set up
- [ ] Sender email `noreply@orjumedia.com` is verified in Brevo

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

1. **Test contact creation:**
   - Submit the form on your site
   - Check Supabase `contacts` table for new entry
   - Check Brevo contacts list for new contact

2. **Test email notification:**
   - Check `hello@orjumedia.com` inbox
   - Verify all form data appears correctly

3. **Test list subscription:**
   - Submit form WITH "stay in touch" checked
   - Verify contact appears in your Brevo marketing list
   - Submit form WITHOUT checkbox
   - Verify contact is NOT added to list

4. **Check function logs:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions logs send-contact-email --tail
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Function not found"**
- Run: `npx supabase functions list`
- If missing, redeploy: `npx supabase functions deploy send-contact-email`

**"Missing BREVO_API_KEY"**
- Verify secrets: `npx supabase secrets list`
- Re-set if needed: `npx supabase secrets set BREVO_API_KEY=your-key`

**"Unauthorized" from Brevo**
- Check API key is correct
- Verify API key permissions (Contacts + SMTP)
- Check sender email is verified

**No email received**
- Check Brevo email logs: https://app.brevo.com/log
- Verify `noreply@orjumedia.com` is verified
- Check spam folder
- View function logs for errors

**Contact not added to list**
- Verify user checked "stay in touch"
- Check list ID is correct
- Verify list exists and is active
- Check function logs

### View Logs

**Real-time logs:**
```bash
npx supabase functions logs send-contact-email --tail
```
